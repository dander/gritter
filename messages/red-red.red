I'm aware of the alpha version and the current flux of Red, that's why I hesitated from implementing some system specific things.^/What I want to achieve: I read on the task list, that the money! type maybe is coming to 1.0, if time allows it.  As I want to implement some DSL (finance) for a finance app with rich GUI and relying on the money! type (because it would be the best fit), I thought about implementing it and/or contributing other stuff. I also saw, that some things are implemented using calls to OS libraries (codecs for PNG, JPEG etc.), but other features are implemented from scratch (e,g, encryption). So if I want to code some codecs or something related to compression/encryption, it would be great to know, when to use OS API calls and when to implement from scratch. }

I use **very ugly** code, which I specialize per header file I want to parse. It is so ugly that I did not published it. These scripts are one purpose scripts... and I didn't wanted to spend time on making them nice and capable to parse correctly everything. I write them as I read the header file. It is not automated process.}

    text: {@Oldes  So this weekend, I wrote an xml parser, then used it to parse the Normative Vulkan Spec into something approximating Red/System code, I was planning on asking here about some of the limitations of Red/System. (arrays, more datatypes) Only to notice that you just commited https://github.com/red/code/blob/master/Library/Vulkan/vulkan.reds 5 days ago (nice job!). It answered many of my questions, but raised another. Do you (or someone) have a red C/C++ header file parser floating around? I was going to have to write at least a partial parser to finish my work on the spec (since they inline a fair amount of C in the xml)^/Also, for everyone, is the general plan to centralize binding code of this type in red/code/Library?}

    text: {@nc-x ^/> BTW @dockimbel, how much performance penalty does the java bridge have? Also, will support for OpenGL ES api be provided in that release?^/^/Less than expected, and it depends on how intensively is the bridge used for a given feature. So far, Draw is the part making the highest number of calls through the bridge, and our early benchmarks (drawing 100k lines) are showing just about 20% performance penalty compared to pure Java. Support for OpenGL should not come in the first release. Wrapping OpenGL API is a simple task, creating a complete abstraction layer on top of it is a big design work.}

The only thing missing in Red to make it work is closure support, which will be available in a future release (not scheduled yet). In the meantime, you can simulate them pretty easily:^/```lisp^/closure: func [vars spec body][bind body-of spec: func spec body context vars :spec]^/^/c: closure [f1: f2: none][f1 f2][func[a][f2 f1 a]]^/f1: func [a [integer!] return: [string!]][mold a]^/f2: func [b [string!]  return: [integer!]][length? b]^/^/f3: c :f1 :f2^/probe f3 12 ^/== 12^/```}

    text: {take the snake game challenge. PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE^/A Snake Game  / basic version^/^/specification by Edward de Jong, version 1^/^/The game runs at 6 frames per second, and the snake moves one cell per frame.  If the snake moves into the apple the length is increased by one, a crunch sound is emitted, and the apple is moved to a new cell. If the snake crosses over itself, then a beep is emitted and the part of the snake from that cell onward is erased. The snake wraps around the board in all four directions.^/^/The playing board, drawn solid black, is subdivided into square cells of 42 points at the screen resolution. Since the window size will not be an even number of cells, the cells are stretched slightly so that all screen space is used by the grid. At the start, the snake is set to length 1 and positioned at cell (4,4). The apple, which is the goal of the snake to eat, is one cell drawn as a circle in HTML color crimson, and is placed at a random location on the board. ^/^/At the start of the game the snake is paused. As soon as an arrow key is pressed, the snake begins to move in that direction, and leaves a trail behind. Initially the trail is limited to 5 cells total. If the snake moves into the Apple, the snake's length grows by 1. Once the apple is eaten, it is immediately respawned into a random new cell. The apple may end up on occasion placed inside the body of the snake, however, the snake only is considered to have eaten the apple if the head moves onto the apple.  The snake cells are drawn as 40 point squares with 2pts on the right and bottom to create a separation. The snake cells are drawn in alternating colors lime green and lawn green. The head of the snake is drawn as a rounded rectangle with a corner radius of 8 pt and a border of 2 pt dark green. The remaining cells of the snake are drawn as a rounded rectangle with 2 pt corner radius. If the snake cells had to be reduced from 42 pt due to window size limitations, then the radii and border thickness are reduced accordingly. ^/^/The only input to the game is the keyboard. The arrow keys change the direction of the snake, however, to prevent frustration the player is not allowed to move the snake head back into itself. So if the snake is traveling east, any attempted movement west is ignored. A command to move in the direction already in motion is ignored. To permit fast maneuvers the direction inputs are queued, so that the player can do WEST - SOUTH - EAST to perform a 180 degree turn in 3 consecutive frames.  Pressing the space bar pauses or resumes the game.^/^/As the snake grows and shrinks, the current size and high score is reported at the top of the screen as a topmost layer at 30% opacity, centered in 28 pt black text, for example: "8   high:22".^/^/The default starting window size is 700 x 700 interior pixels. If the user resizes the window, the game is reset back to the starting state.^/^/Note: since the window size will not usually be an even multiple of 42 points, the cells are slightly stretched to not have any dead space leftover.  If the given window size is too small to accommodate at least 10 cells in both directions, the cellsize is reduced. So the program must first figure out how many the proper cell size such that at least 10 cells can fit in the X and Y directions, but no larger than 42 pts in size, then divide the width and height by the number of cells in each direction, and then pad the cells by the leftover amount so that the cell grid fills the space perfectly.^/^-^/External resources:^/^-crunch.mp3 sound ^/^-beep.mp3 sound^/^-you are given a window size in pixels, and the resolution of the device.^/o^-device resolution might vary from 86 dpi (desktop), to 500+ dpi (mobile)^/^/An example of a subset of this game, written in real time in under 5 minutes in JavaScript can be seen on youtube at:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs^/^/The 5 minute coding example has no scaling of the grid, doesn't keep score, and a few other things, but does show impressive coding speed.^/^/^/^/}

Don't let fear rule the day though, or discount how much elegant and correct code has been written without functors and monads. I skimmed your link, but my brain hasn't opened it's Haskell receptors yet (or maybe Redbol deactivated them), so it doesn't appear at all elegant to me. "To me" is the important part there. ^/^/I love concrete examples because, for me, they facilitate discussion. What is a good, real world, example we can use as a basis for comparison? I like the 7GUIs idea, imperfect as it may be, because it does just this. But if there are others, let's put them in a doc and see how we'd approach the same problems in Red. }

You can pass functions without evaluating them, but because Red has free-ranging evaluation, if you don't evaluate a function, the caller (`f` in your example) can't know how many arguments to consume. You could do it by passing the func and all the args in a block, but that may not be what you're after. That's where I'm not clear. You have `f` in the output as well, so maybe you have another level?}

In reality, there is no scope in Red: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21964110/is-there-a-overall-explanation-about-definitional-scoping-in-rebol-and-red/21964858#21964858^/^/The other thing to remember, is that Red is data first. Everything is data until it's evaluated. Learning the evaluation rules, i.e., when it occurs, will help it all make sense.}

I did it long ago, before Red built it in, and commented on the ticket @meijeru opened for it.^/```^/to-path: func [spec][^/^-; LOAD FORM is used to clean up specs that have refinements ^/^-; in them.

In the next line `print type? :to-string` works as expected because `:to-string` gets the body of the function *without evaluating it*, `print` recieves `function!`, prints `function` and returns **`unset`**... which, passed out back to firtst `to-string`, causes and error.}

They are planned, but not in place yet.  @dockimbel  even worked up a simple example that didn't require a temporary context. ^/^/For those of us who are impatient, myself included, the design process can seem drawn out. Ultimately, though, it's very rewarding when we take the time to consider all the details. So, it's not just about what has proven useful in other languages, but in making their utility available in the context of Red, and maintaining its conceptual integrity as best we can.

Your example was good, but if what you want to do is compose layouts given a combination of fixed and replaceable parts, `compose` is your friend. `Bind` is a very powerful tool, but not needed in most code. Fun to play with though.}

You will still need to watch rounding, as you would with any type.  I thought that that was how the backend of the Money! type worked since floats are fraught with peril.  I constantly have to check on their rounding behaviors in conversions from double->single and double->int (in C++).}

Your English beats my Italian every day. :^^) If I ask for clarification, it could be a technical matter as much as anything, wanting to make sure I understand the problem so I don't give bad advice.^/^/The answer is easy. `Float!` should *never* be used for decimal values where accuracy is important, because it can't represent all decimal values. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic#Accuracy_problems^/^/This won't always be visible, but it's there:^/```^/>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 ^/== 0.3^/>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 * 10000000000000000^/== 3000000000000001.0^/```^/When working with money values, rounding errors can add up. I worked with a guy, many years ago, who developed empirical solutions for it, which was pretty amazing. It worked in our domain, but I don't think was generalizable. The solution is to use BCD or some other representation that can accurately handle decimal values. That's the plan for `money!` in Red, but could also be a general `decimal!` type that money is built on. The issue then is what `1.0` means as a literal, float or decimal. Floats are faster, because of hardware support. ^/^/There are other interesting approaches as well, but that should be enough for now.}

    text: {Github supports Asciidoc and it appear that there's a bitbucket plugin for it too. The LWN kernelorg article prefers sphynx over asciidoc not for any better flexibility in sphynx's syntax but rather that it's written in python compared to asciidoctor's ruby and there doesn't already exist ruby code in the kernel tree. The article points out that asciidoc should be a better choice in the future, but sphynx is a better choice (for *their* needs) now. I think Red should stick with asciidoc. There hasn't been mention here of the Red documentation project suffering from a lack of functionality in asciidoctor's syntax or toolchain. Changing just for changing's sake is not wise.}

I'm speaking from the perspective of not-so-recent community member - Redbol has a steep learning curve because it's *conceptually different* from mainstream languages and because documentation (for the most part) is scarse, undetailed and decentralized.^/^/I know that some community members are doing their part and provide articles and learning material (and I deeply appreciate that!), but their efforts are, in a vague sense, *spontaneous* and *uncoordinated* with Red team's plans. What I propose is: instead of fighting "lack of documentation" issue each by itself, perhaps these community efforts should be coordinated and guided as a collaborative initiative, while Fullstack can continue do their job?}

As I understand, Linux has about 2 percent of the desktop market. I believe that does include a disproportionately large percentage of developers. (Who, I suspect, in the main develop either server-side software or web-based software). I would imagine that such people will be more interested in a Red web framework and Red web server than GTK3 apps.^/^/Personally, I am very keen to see the Red GTK3 backend finished as then Red will be an ideal learning tool for the Raspberry Pi. We could see a whole army of young Red programmers! I just don't know if it fits in with Fullstack's plans.}

It's a really simple application, a list of text items, that when touched, each one plays a different audio file. Is Red in its current state good for this exercise? If so, where can I see a simple guide or example to start from?}

    text: {Since we have a number of new people joining recently, just a quick comment on Red's state. As @rebolek said, GC is coming, and you can see more roadmap details on Trello. Red is currently still considered Alpha, but it's easy to think of it as more "mature" because of its stability and the advanced features in many areas (e.g. reactive GUIs). There is a sound plan and reasoning behind the order of development and priorities. There are a few notes in https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Red-Project-Approach on that.^/^/If you are new here, welcome, and don't be shy. You will have the same questions a lot of others have had, and will surely learn a lot by playing with Red. The team is closing a lot of tickets right now, in preparation for the next release push. If you think you found a bug, post a message. Others will jump in to confirm, and then you can file a ticket (Yay!). If you have WISH tickets, again, post here and get some feedback before filing them. Processing tickets and issues is a lot of work, even just reviewing them.^/^/Happy Reducing!}

Quite surprising how quickly I got the basics working under Red. Go Team Red! Having the `/options/style` facet available in Red now helped a lot, as the old code used the style of a face. A lot of other things were just removing code, showing faces manually, updating line-lists in text-list faces, etc. Stuff that Red does automatically.^/^/It was written in 2001, when I was just a Rebol noob, so there are some things I would like to clean up a bit before putting it out there. Ping me if you don't see it in a week, or if you want an early preview. ^/^/Every day I love Red all over again. }

You can use `function` constructor instead, which will automatically gather set-words and iterartor words for you (though, we consider that such constructor should be used by advanced users only, as it can create unwanted side-effects if you don't have a clear understanding of the gathering rules).}

The "pathological cases" mentioned only account for extremely convoluted code patterns,  while ignoring the common cases arising from code exchanges in I/O operations, when deserializating code, which precludes static analysis. Funny that they mention the "fallback to interpreter at run-time" solution for that, as that's the precise answer I give to the main question Andreas (an accointance  of Viktor) kept asking me during the same year that paper was published, both online and live in Austria when we met there. Though, I don't doubt they could have come up with such trivial solution by themselves, it's still a funny coincidence to me. ;-)^/* I find it great that someone has the time and will to work on such topic and try to push the boundaries there. I'll try to get in touch with Viktor to see if he made any significant advances in the last two years.}

Most functions in Red doing implicit series allocations are providing ways to reuse existing series (the `/into` refinement). That will be extended to cover more functions, so that, if you want, you could write Red apps with GC turned off, and still have a stable memory usage. If you look at some of our demos in red/code repository, we are already using that to keep memory usage stable or increasing very slowly.}

    text: {@tanstaaf1 I do go back, maybe once a year, to that first blog article and reflect on the beginning of this incredible adventure. There would be a lot to say about the whole Red story, and what's driving me, maybe I should  write it all down someday and publish it (we'll see that after Red 2.0). ;-)^/^/> What is in your head right now as you look to 6.4, specifically, and the incredibly steep trail still ahead?^/^/That is not how I see it. For me, we passed the top of the Red mountain after 0.6.2 and we are now descending, which means faster pace and easier, though the mountain being very high and full of obstacles, it's still a relatively long way down. ;-) What is in my head right now would take many pages to describe, so I'll just reduce it to the most important concern right now: how to make a satisfying 0.6.4 while spending as little time as possible on it, so we can advance on the last big milestones. Not only those last milestones are critical for us to be able to reach our goals, but they are also very exciting challenges, for which I already have battle plans, so I'm impatient to dive in!^/^/> From the first blog entry it is clear you envisioned large parts of what has been created but that your vision and path were subject to change.^/^/Change is the only constant thing in life. ;-) Path has changed slightly, but the vision is still the same. Here are the main causes of changing my initial plan:^/* I realized during the first year that building the "static" Red first, then the "dynamic" Red later was not satisfying to me, as I would miss the Rebol-like flexibility in the "static" Red too much, so will most probably the users, so I decided to switch them and do the "dynamic" Red first (on par with Rebol) and leave the "static" one for later.^/* Support for floats, Linux, ARM and many other non-Core features were not planned to be implemented before 1.0. Without that, we could have moved way faster to 1.0. Though, because of the community contributions and pressure, especially the first couple of years, I relaxed my plans for the greater good. When the opportunity to access to VC money presented itself, GUI became another low-priority feature that had to move to first position.^/* I have fully embraced the open source way of building software from the beginning. That comes with big benefits, but also costs, like a big part of my time being spent on interacting with countless people on daily basis. I didn't account for that cost at all in my initial plan, mainly because I didn't expect that many followers until 1.0. Among those followers, both from Rebol community and newcomers, I tried/try to absorb and process as much knowledge and experience they were/are willing to share with me, so this results in, sometimes, changing my opinion on some features or priorities.^/* I have invested all my personal money into Red during the first couple of years, after running out of money, I had to change some plans, or stop.^/^/> I look at trello and I have some specifics on what you hope will make it in 6.4, but very little real assurance I really understand the vision.^/^/The 0.6.4 is an important milestone that will make the GUI console the central piece of the Red world. We have big plans for the console, 0.6.4 is just a first move into that direction. I prefer not to give more details on that until it's actually built.^/^/> I think it might be worthwhile (maybe even helpful for maintaining your energy) to give as a vision vs reality checkup after these years and, perhaps, occasionally going forward??^/^/I'm not sure to understand precisely what you mean there. The vision has not changed since day 1, the goals are still the same, only the priorities for the different tasks and milestones have changed.}

There is a lot to read between there and 6.3, of course, but even the little wayback gave me a sense of awe (at how much was undertaken and how far you've come) and curiosity:  What is in your head right now as you look to 6.4, specifically, and the incredibly steep trail still ahead?  From the first blog entry it is clear you envisioned large parts of what has been created but that your vision and path were subject to change.  I look at trello and I have *some* specifics on what you hope will make it in 6.4, but very little real assurance I really understand the vision.  I think it might be worthwhile (maybe even helpful for maintaining your energy) to give as a vision vs reality checkup after these years and, perhaps, occasionally going forward??   Very much admire your courage and intellect. Doubly so after taking a few minutes to go wayback.}

But I think this would be among the first which would be a *composable* dialect, where you can use SQL syntax as a starting point to build custom DSLs to query and manipulate data. I *think* that's a new one.  Also, there are a few known projects where SQL is used to scan file-systems, OSquery in particular.}

I can use ISO and feel good about that.  Nobody will waste time trying to figure out why their date code isn't working because your REPL, unlike R2, is quite specific.  So my thanks was sincere.   What is the internal data representation?  You likely document this somewhere but I've missed it.}

If there's anyone interested in implementing such function, the ISO week spec is [there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date). We just need a single `set-iso-week` function, taking a `date!` value and a week integer number, returning a new date set on the first day of that week. You can use our set of [unit tests](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/tests/source/units/date-test.red#L680) to validate it. I didn't implement it for lack of time, though a contribution would be greatly appreciated.}

R3 made matters worse by adding `ajoin`. It's worth some brain work to improve things. I have a `join/combine` experiment that also works on objects and maps.

    text: {I'm glad to see some discussion about releases & info. I see and appreciate the frequent builds are available for download, but it's not easy to see what's new (or experimental) in those builds. It would be great if beside that download link, there was another link to a change log summary in easy to read form (I'm not familiar with the commit viewing process) - so if no change log page could be auto-collated or presented, then a tip on the download page for more info about commit viewing may be helpful. Therefore, currently I'm trying later builds rather blindly, so in that case, I stick with 0.6.2 (for better or worse). I agree that a version number (increment or otherwise) may not be so important (but is very good psychologically), but easily accessible and good info about what's in any release is the key thing.}

    text: {@maximvl > but once a time with a certain amount of changes the big release should happen^/^/What you call "big release" is a tag on a commit + a bumped version number + a blog article. We use a continuous release model since many years, so the "releases" with a version number are just milestones, they don't bring *any* feature that was not already there in the repo and in the last automated build. It's amazing to me that such simple model is so hard to understand for some followers. Though, I'm not surprised that some people care more about incrementing version numbers than available features. If we stopped making "milestone releases", that wouldn't change anything about what and when new features would be available, so for Red followers, that would make strictly no difference.}

I can understand the push towards official milestone release, as mostly a psychological factor - ppl not following the project on a daily basis, can see a blog article and know the project is progressing - simply a release early, release often strategy. It also might make sense, if you don't have daily builds available, which we have. Well, and then there is a burden for Doc to write a blog article :-)}

Going the other way, embedding Red in Julia gives it access to easy GUIs, parsing, DSLs/dialects, mobile platforms (soon). ^/I second @rebolek's request - it'd be nice to have a red/julia section in order to keep things on topic.}

That is, from Red cam Julia. Fine with me if this is even better. }

    text: {@geekyi, Doc recently pointed me to Quora, and I ended up answering a question that aligns with your issues. The answer is context. How we structure our code, for an audience to read and understand, is up to us. With Rebol, we write for ourselves or in small teams, where things naturally, invisibly, seem clear, because you know who you're talking to. As Red projects grow, there will surely be more separation used by teams to organize things. Possibly along dialect lines, but not always. Just as you would have to adjust when reading mixed topics in any area, or fiction with varying timelines and subplots,  it's up to the author to help you navigate the story and information.}

The difference between `:a` and `get 'a` lies in the fact that the unset value gives an error with `get 'a` and not with `:a`, although with a function value they both prevent function application, yielding the function value as result itself. That is a subtle difference to be kept in mind! }

This seems a roundabout way of achieving the goal: preventing a routine to be defined and used in the interpreter. After all, there is `system/state/interpreted?` to check if one is in the interpreter. Thus, `make routine!` could be implemented with that check.}

The great thing, of course, is that you can build things in Red to prove them out. It may not be as pretty as we'd like sometimes, but it can probably be done. e.g. write your funcs and doc their customizable bits, then bind them into a context that has those customizations.}

    text: {Searching is an operation, which involves comparisons. I think that's already too much, but it's implemented so you can use it. I think you really misunderstand the purpose of `handle!` which is to *hide* information from the user, because it's a lower-layer abstraction that we allow to leak to higher level, for specific purpose (and not for general purpose). In View engine, we use it to expose the low-level objects underlying each face, so that users could extend View engine by calling external API and passing that handle. That's the only reason it is exposed, otherwise we could just keep it at R/S level. That is where `handle!` comes handy, to make it *opaque*, so that users don't bother with it, nor modify it in any way. Another usage (not implemented yet), is for the native call stack pointer returned in `error!` objects.}

Splitting the doc string to a separate line is no better. It all depends on the combination of things in the spec. Note that it will affect refinement params as well.^/^/Thoughts or suggestions? Mocking up output is probably best for discussion.}

But would you agree red will defer l2r evaluation in order to resolve an *indeterminate* number of things to the right?  And given the sheer number of words plus refinements and unusual characters that creates a bit of a slippery slope for, at least, untrained minds to gain purchase.   Sort of like reading run-on sentences in English.   It would be really nice for the interpreter to explain itself, so to speak.  It seems that is best done right to left (except where the statement is malformed, of course, where it should throw an error of some sort).  Anyway, it IS a deep lake -- but a deep lake CAN be transparent, and the red interpreter/REPL could be too, and that would take away a huge portion of the confusion.  My main frustration, anyway.}

If red parses from left to right but evaluates from right to left then it makes sense to have at least a rudimentary debug facility which would show things in evaluation order.  }

    text: {Has anyone been hacking on debugging?  I don't see much mention of debugging work in the threads nor in the trello roadmap.  Absent that, does anyone on red-team have any conjecture on when some sort of debugger will show up or what that might look like?  I'd love to see something which would display a code statement in terms of how sections of it are successively parsed and evaluated.   Most of my personal difficulties with red continue to revolve around not understanding how longer statements are actually evaluated by the parser.   Being able too more easily tease out the step by step interpretation would probably save me 90% of my wasted time.  Maybe it would be appropriate, at some point, to open a room for more pointed discussion?}

    text: {red-by-example looks useful but I have never seen that before your mention.  For me Red simply uses an obscure syntax and its difficult to fully get my head around it in the absence of effective documentation.  Reading examples helps but sometimes it's extremely difficult to figure out down to each element what it is doing and then extrapolate that to doing other code - the nested blocks.  I think it just needs better documentation to help beginners from other languages, bear in mind that many who pick it up will be hobbyists and not focused entirely on Red itself in their early usage}

However, programmers come in shades of gray. Red is *very* accessible to casual programmers, as BASIC and VB have been. And also, though we have some thought to apply in the presentation, like Logo. What Red promises, in one narrow view, is the ability for each level of competency in programming to build tools and share with other levels, without resorting to different languages.}

It should probably get the best name (`bindable-word!` is clear in meaning, but probably too long). @meijeru, I don't think we can say that having "word" in the name should decide that, because it doesn't apply to the other `any-*` typesets. I still don't want to lock `issue!` down as a literal either, holding out hope for the "smart issue" idea, or (less nice) the double `##` sigil to denote word vs string issues. `Symbol!` is used internally, and I've already said why I don't like `lexeme!`. I can't come up with anything better right now. As @meijeru suggests, maybe we forego the new typeset name until we can come up with a good one. }

How many times does it occur in the toolchain, or in user programs for that matter, that `refinement!` and `issue!` are put into one basket with words? I have said before that `issue!` is really a kind of literal, and I have understood that its definition and usage are to be discussed. And  refinements really occur  only in function-specs... It is not a loss if both cannot be used anymore as keys in map, since all "words" are collapsed into `word!` anyhow for that purpose. @doc can probably say which of the two proposals for change will give the most work in updating the toolchain, but my vote is for the new `any-word!` and not providing a new name for the old one.}

That is necessary, as you could easily crash compiled functions that way (changes in body block of compiled functions are obviously ignored). You need to recreate the function if you want to change its spec block.}

If so, and we can just imagine that he did, why *didn't* he use two separate notations? And why limit to just 2 values, when he could easily have made it 3 as well?}

If the new syntax is limited to float values (just thinking out loud), that would keep people from using it *in place of* pair syntax. My reasoning there is that people might want to adopt the new, and ask for support in all GUI related areas, which means we have to scan for both. But if you're doing 3D calcs and such, you will *have to* map to a 2D space. Need to think about how that will look.^/^/I also agree that we likely won't write these as literals much, but we could have a lot of data files with them.

I use commas extensively in large numbers of many sorts.  Might I suggest there are a huge number of pretty unique characters in the unicode which will now be supported (https://unicode-table.com/en/#control-character) and maybe you can make more use of them to provide both unambiguous (or less anyway) context and content?   If there isn't pretty much pan-national agreement what proper syntax is I'd suggest you not be too quick to commit Red to one particular syntax which is already in contention.  The discussion about ambiguity on date format differences should be kept in mind - European date formats are NOT used in the US.  I'm pretty confident that for the the next century, at least, 1/12/17 will continue to mean January 12, 2017 in the US.    Assuming, of course, that you want Red to be one of the first real international languages I think it would be nice to use unambigous (not previously regionally co-opted) unicode characters to resolve international ambiguities more than has been done to date.

It's possible, though not likely, that our suggestions will hit upon some heretofore undiscovered bit of syntax that is better than the current pair syntax or Doc's idea. ^/^/A lot of it is what we get used to. `(1, 2, 3)` feels different because there's an implicitness to the rules. That all values have to be numbers *and* have a comma after it, seems funny right now. There is nothing to indicate that you can't just add more values, because it looks like a normal list.  A single dimension. Where `×` implies, to me, different dimensions which, unless you're into superstrings, are fairly limited. Every new syntax is like that though. We just stop seeing it after while. I really disliked `keep` in `collect` when it was adopted, but am (mostly) used to it now. ;^^)}

    text: {A dialect in Redbol, is equivalent to an "embedded" DSL, it shares the same syntax (it is LOADable) as the main language, but has domain-specific semantics. And "external" DSL has different syntax and semantics (it's string-based and not LOADable).^/^/About the "DO dialect" concept (mentioned in some wikis about Rebol), it has been used by some Rebol3 contributors, but Carl (Rebol's author) never acknowledged such concept (I've asked Carl about that in the Redbol conference in 2013), nor do I. The reason is that a "dialect" derives from a "language", so Red and Rebol are languages, from which dialects are derived. Red can also be considered a dialect of Rebol (a language can be a dialect of some other language).}

    text: {@maximvl There are two different realms, Red is very high-level, Red/System is as close to the hardware as C (even closer actually, thanks to its `system/*` instrinsic features). R/S manipulates values which can fit into CPU/FPU registers, while Red handles only boxed values. Typical R/S code runs two orders of magnitude faster than Red code (for the cases where such comparison makes sense). As a rule of thumb, you should use Red by default, and keep R/S only for the most CPU-intensive tasks (see the [mandelbrot-fast.red](https://github.com/red/code/blob/master/Scripts/mandelbrot-fast.red) and [perlin.red](https://github.com/red/code/blob/master/Scripts/perlin.red) scripts as examples). Moreover, R/S requires compilation for now, while Red can run on the interpreter, so you should add the R/S code dependency last (as a last optimization stage), to minimize your development time.}

They are deleted once the console is compiled. As the previous attempt failed, you see them lying in the folder. I still see no good reason why it would error out like that, though @qtxie might have an idea.}

I'm going to try and find some well written C code to see if there is a straightforward way - ideally something with straightforward logic to copy.  Otherwise, and until then, I'll shelf my suggestion.  Maybe the red module system will be like a dream come true, but in general I seldom find software contingencies that easy to resolve (it's not my job to stay up with kinky software requirements, I'm supposed to be running companies).  I'll long remember the nightmare of installing haskell + code editor + yesod framework; took me 3 days to find all the hidden secrets of even getting things to run on canned code before I gave up.

If it is pretty straightforward maybe it can be added without too much effort.  I'm pretty sure it would make for huge bragging rights - as well as quite practical.  For really quite small databases (which I'm guessing make up 80%+ of all the databases created by causal or personal users) this might be all that is needed for a full app.  At least it would get things started.  As I said, if you really need to use full SQLite capability you install SQLite and learn how to interact with it.  But this would probably be good enough for 80%+ of use cases and certainly to get things rolling.}

Red's built-in GUI support is huge and quite rare; SQLite file support would, I think, make a unique offering.  Obviously everything added makes extra size and extra work; but why would basic support for the file format add that much size?  In addition to business apps, this also fits well with the mobile target as I understand a high percentage of apps use SQLite.  Thoughts?}

Increase in computation power is now horizontal, with multiple cores, multiple processors and distributed architectures, so, strong concurrency support is a key part of a modern general-purpose language.^/^/>For now, the model we aim at is the Actor model. It is a good fit for Red and would provide a clean way to handle concurrent and parallel tasks across multiple cores and processors. Though, a few years has passed since that plan was made, so we will need to revisit it when the work on 0.9.0 will start, and define what is the best option for Red then. One thing is sure, we do not want multithreading nor callback hell in Red. ;-)"}

Please give me concrete examples to work against." Often this leads to "It has to be as fast as possible." While that's always nice, we don't know what that is unless we build the fastest one. My take is that things have to be fast *enough*, which is a soft constraint that varies by context. Animation and games have minimum response times or FPS goals, real-time systems have hard limits, but most performance requirements are very, very soft. 0:5:0 vs 0:0:5 may not matter at all, but a working solution in 5 days vs 5 weeks may be huge.}

In Red we can emulate almost any behavior, but we don't have best practices for doing so yet. The recent chat on with/using/let/dynamic might be used to think about how we go about it. For missing methods, we could emulate it with objects, but it might be better in the standard path evaluator. That will add overhead though. And then we have to think about how it works for function refinements. Do you have a similar handler for "refinement missing"? If so, how does that work compared to remaking functions. ^/^/Multiple dispatch can make for lots of separate functions. Red's type checking system lets us combine shared behavior in different ways, but it's fundamental design also means we may not *want* to emulate certain things. }

    text: {Rich hickey once discussed that he did not like pattern matching because it was closed, while he did like multimethods because they were open.^/^/It took me some time to digest what he was saying but basically it is this; if you want to extend the patterns a function is matching you must alter its source, while with multimethods you can extend what it matches by simply writing another multimethod in your own source. If you were to use someones library, with their multimethods, you could easily extend what those methods match, without altering the library at the source level. This means that you can extend any data structure with new multimethods without ever needing to mess with the original implementation of the method.^/^/When programming in red it dawned on me that red takes that idea to the extreme, literally every single thing in the language is extensible. You could import someones lib and extend their code just by altering the data that the code is composed of; you do not have to touch the source code of the library at all. In this sense, all of red is open, while every other language is closed in one form or another.^/^/}

Now the question is, if making an introduction to Red there, would be welcomed (ppl being open-minded) or contraproductive? What do you guys think? ( @dockimbel ) . I might try to contact that guy and at least have some basic info exchange?}

I'm new to code as well (started about 8 months ago, I know some C++ and JavaScript, working on Java right now) and am very interested in investing time and energy into teaching myself Red. The simplicity and speed is extremely appealing to me as a beginner especially, and it seems like the flexibility suits a lot of my eventual goals. Keep up the good work!

No deadline pressure that way. :^^) Red looks familiar in many ways, but is quite different under the hood, so it can take some time to ramp up, and there are a few gotchas that catch everyone when they start. Get those out of the way and you'll be in better shape to do real work when the time comes. }

Though, using the console app directly (cross-compiling it from another platform) should work fine. Rebol and R3 are just an interpreter in an executable (same as our "console" app), the `red` binary is a toolchain, which pre-builds some libraries used during the compilation process. As `red` cannot run by default on your platform, the console app cannot be built, so it requires cross-compilation in your specific case.}

    text: {On `split-path`, long ago there was quite some discussion on the R2 behavior WRT `rejoin`. That is, should `split-path` produce values that recreate the original when rejoined. split-path+rejoin test-case results where that doesn't hold true in Red:^/```^/input       output^/%foo        %./foo^/%""         %./^/%/          %/none^/%.          %./none^/%./         %./none^/%./.        %././^/%..         %../none^/%../        %../none^/%../..      %../../^/%foo/..     %foo/../^/%foo/.      %foo/./^/%foo/../.   %foo/.././^/http://..   http://../^/http://.    http://./^/http://../. http://.././^/```^/It looks like Red matches R2 behavior. The main differences between that and `rejoin` consistency is that you'll get an empty file (`%""`) rather than none at times, and trailing `%.` or `%..` don't get dirized.}

This would also allow different levels of "help" (training wheels) which I think would be especially fitting and needed with Red (deep lake and all that). I think the biggest problem Red is going to face in general acceptance is restricting its visible complexity for people who are just trying to safely get rolling around the block.}

Though, I think nowadays that the compiler should be able to process it properly as a simple word. But it might be good to keep it anyway, as a visual clue for readers that we are not using the `all` native. I am not sure if we need to make it a strict convention, as `next` which is also a refinement in that function, reads fine (at least to me) as a word inside the `case` body. So, it depends on the context, if it can be ambiguous, using the get-word form should be considered a good practice.}

Well, some might say that `parse`is difficult to get info, hence I wonder - could there be some meta-abstraction, or how to call it, for `parse`, to easy the creation of dialects/rules?}

Took 7 verbs to get a rough count.^/^/Well, the real number of unique items in the document could be 900 or 1500, you can't know unless you analyze the junk parts. If the input is short enough, you can do a quick visual review and guesstimate an error margin. If the input is big (not possible to review visually), then you need to analyze the junk parts, and calculate a good approximation for the error margin. Depending on the context and structure of the input, this can go from "pretty easy" to "terribly hard/long". But I don't want to diminish your enthousiasm ;-), I'm curious about the feedback of your experiments, and how much it can really help in a corporate environment.^/^/Maybe a kind of "visual lab" tool, for cutting a random input text into pieces, and be able to quickly tweak different kind of analyzers to extract some stats (with semi-assisted error margin calculator), could be a useful tool for some companies.}

But it would still let a professor load the combined works of Shakespeare to get a close count of how many times "thee" was used.  It they wanted to publish the count and still keep a reputation, they would need to do iterative loads with edits until no unclassified data was found (or look and see that all the unclassified data was reasonable as some form of librarian data or stray commas).  But what you may end up with is thousands of professors using Red as a tool of first round analysis.

When data is smooshed into OTHERWISE-UNCLASSIFIED!, all bets are off in terms of reproducibility after a system update.  Or even, changing a single comma coming up with a completely different set.  The algorithm could be explained as simply, loaded junk (which is triggered whenever a syntax error would be flagged), marked it, and continued from the next character; your use of LOAD/ANY is temporal and not reliable, but here's a block!, go ahead and use it for now, results will always be deemed fuzzy and inaccurate until corrections are made.^/^/That was the point of the link (kinda), provide a tool that a computer scientist may eschew (so they don't use LOAD/ANY) but that a normal person could load any old text file and then get a quick count of how many integer! elements are inside.   (Or url! or word!, etc).  Perhaps a linter could quickly point out how many elements are normally non-loadable, but still do the load and provide a count.  LOAD/ANY would NOT be for code, as it would lead to disaster.  But an author loading a markdown file just to get today's count of swear words +/- the weird ISBN number that normally would cause a syntax error and the odd exclamation won't really care (until they need to actually care).  Make the algorithm simple.  Triggered on syntax error, continue from next character.  When one or more UNCLASSIFIED! elements are found, put up a warning of an unreliable load.^/^/Again, I'm not out to make you mad or make you feel like you'd be corrupting or tainting Red, Nenad, I'm just of the belief that providing a tool feature that is less than 100% reliable but very easy to use will make a lot of people very happy.

    text: {@btiffin We've been through this discussion many times, so I don't want to re-open it, but just to remind you that there is no algorithm for what you ask for. An undefined text segment can start where all the lexer rules fail, but there is no reliable method for determining where such segment ends for arbitrary text inputs. This means that each time we change/fix the lexer rules, you will get a different result from a LOAD/ANY on the *same* input text. It is the same class of problem as trying to find a compression method for reducing the size of arbitrary data. If you would write down an exhaustive set of parsing rules you want for a LOAD/ANY, that would help (and would also narrow down the kind of text input which could give usable results).}

Catching type errors works great, as long as you spec the types and write your code accordingly. The more flexibility you want, the more work you'll need to do. Values are strongly typed, and Red's large array of datatypes means that you can catch a lot of errors other languages can't.^/^/Terrifying indeed. :^^) Not all types have a literal form. Lexical space is just too tight for that, without things becoming line noise.}

Since racket and even python (per a comment I heard from Guido in a podcast) are going to working to support at least some optional typesafety, I expect Red can be modified to do so as well.  But, again, I think this is a question for @dockimbel.  And his calendar is pretty full, even if it sees it as a desirable and achievable  longer term feature.  Right now he is working hard for a near term release of 0.62, I think; that's a big achievement.}

So easy to plug the language into foreign stuff - run something, get the result into buffer, parse it. There is also SQLite light "protocol" for R2, which simply calls SQLite.exe and parses the output - it just works :-)}

Now when I double-click the file, it ends, and `rc`does return some Driver internal error. But maybe I just forgot, how to use it properly or should switch to use the red.exe :-)}

It needs a champion, as our resources are limited. Whether "optimized mathematical axiomatic routines should be a core feature of every programming language" comes down to tradeoffs. I haven't needed them in my work, and every feature has a cost. As we fight to keep things simple, we have to be open to the most important new features we don't have yet, without including everything. Since Red can be compiled, it will be possible to build a version of Red (NumRed) that does all that, while the general purpose version doesn't. Then we have to fight to keep from proliferating versions. :^^)}

    text: {@dockimbel [Your “proposition for maps”](https://gitter.im/red/red?at=5831968db563b5516c41e69b) would definitely work, providing the following details were implied:^/^/**1. Literal maps could contain `none!` values**^/Eg:^/```lisp^/red>> m: #(a 1 b #[none])^/== #(^/    a: 1^/    b: none^/)^/red>> mold/all m^/== {#(^^/    a: 1^^/    b: #[none]^^/)}^/```^/^/This is because:^/ 1. Otherwise, `load`ing a `save/all` or `mold/all`d map would be lossy.^/ 2. Otherwise, one couldn't construct all maps in one pass.^/ 3. I see no reason for the key to be discarded in this case, as there is no reason for a user to bother including `#[none]` in the construction if the key was unwanted.^/ 4. This is analogous to `/case` currently working in `m: #(a 1 A 2)` to keep both keys, which I assume is for similar reasons.^/^/I suppose this would also be the case for `m: make map! [a: 1 b: #[none]]`^/^/However, I don't know about the following statement:^/^/> “Moreover, LOADing a serialized map would reduce the none word if present as value.”^/^/You may have to give an example, but if this means what I think it does, I'm not sure that it would be necessary, and may be confusing (since other values aren't reduced) and even unwanted (especially if a word were intended).^/Is there a good reason for this part of the suggestion that I'm missing here? Otherwise, it seems to me that it's just for a small convenience which would be better met by `none` having it's own default literal form, and thus solving the problem everywhere. I was previously liking `_` for this, but I'm currently hoping for something less likely to be used in words. Maybe `\`. Anyway, that's for a different discussion.^/^/**2. Both keys with `none!` values and non-existent keys would return `none`**^/I think this is kind of obvious, but I'll make it explicit just in case. Eg:^/```lisp^/red>> m^/== #(^/    a: 1^/    b: none^/)^/red>> m/a^/== 1^/red>> m/b^/== none^/red>> m/c^/== none^/```^/^/To check the difference between keys with `none!` values and non-existent keys, I suggest extending `value?`. Eg:^/```lisp^/red>> value? 'm/b^/== true^/red>> value? 'm/c^/== false^/```^/This would also extend to objects. Eg:^/```lisp^/red>> o: make object! [a: 1 b: none]^/== make object! [^/    a: 1^/    b: none^/]^/red>> value? 'o/b^/== true^/red>> value? 'o/c^/== false^/```^/Currently, that last line returns:^/```lisp^/== true^/```^/However, even if `value?` weren't extended, one could always achieve the same result with:^/```lisp^/red>> to logic! find keys-of m 'b^/== true^/red>> to logic! find keys-of m 'c^/== false^/```^/^/**3. `set`ting a key to `none` without using `/any` still removes keys, even if their value was already `none`**^/Again, this seems obvious to me, but I just wanted to clarify. Eg:^/```lisp^/red>> m^/== #(^/    a: 1^/    b: none^/)^/red>> set 'm/b none^/== none^/red>> m^/== #(^/    a: 1^/)^/```^/^/When you said:^/> “It would also be safe to re-use unset on map keys, as an additional way to remove keys”^/^/I assume you meant `unset 'm/a` as you'd already mentioned just above it, and not `m/a: ()` as in my original proposal. As I see it, neither would be necessary, but the former may be desired.^/However, `unset` may also be expected to work on objects. Eg:^/```lisp^/red>> o^/== make object! [^/    a: 1^/    b: none^/]^/red>> unset 'o/b^/red>> o^/== make object! [^/    a: 1^/]^/```^/Should it be possible to remove a word from an object? Is it already possible and I've missed how?^/^/Anything I've missed or misunderstood?}

    text: {@dockimbel @geekyi @greggirwin I figured out what was going on. I was using scoop to try to update to the latest automated build, but it was using a cached version of the download. What I don't understand is why it was reporting the build version that it did. When I would run red.exe from the scoop shim, it would regenerate the crush.dll and gui-console from 2016-11-26-64912 inside ProgramData, and seemed to be running using those. Does it make any sense that it would report an updated build number if it was so old?^/There is a 'disable cache' flag `-k` on scoop, and when I added that, it successfully updated.}

Add typesets and varying behaviors and you get the usual combinatorial explosion of possibilities. How do we create *useful* docs without overwhelming the user? ^/Because of Red's reflective capabilities, one way would be to enhance the help functions, so you can just ask what funcs take an arg of type X. e.g.:^/```^/red>> what-takes? string!^/a-an           ^/charset        ^/checksum       : Computes a checksum, CRC, hash, or HMAC^/clean-path     : Cleans-up '.' and '..' in path; returns the cleaned path^/debase         : Decodes binary-coded string (BASE-64 default) to binary value^/...^/```^/I'll have to put more work into my quick hack on this (which produced the above) to make it useful, but the concept is the idea.}

Yes, I know, it helps to have guides that orient you.  And any Rebol2 resources are largely valid from a language design standpoint, at least for the interpreter and fundamentals. Only Red has a full cross compiler, macros, and more. ^/^/This brings me to your offer of help. Yes! OK, you'll be helping by starting it, but if you see the need, let's get it rolling. People new to Red have the best perspective on what new people need. And how best to explain things, or what to cover, depend on the environment and language you're coming *from*. When I found Rebol, I started a "Rebol for VB Programmers" idea, including mezzanines to provide familiar functions.^/^/}

This is in contrast to Atom, which is a lot more fully featured but often slows down, and has a longer start up time. Also in contrast to Sublime, which is great, but is relatively expensive and is not updated as frequently.}

Do not use `to` or `thru` otherwise line counting won’t work. There are also two refinements, `/quiet` to suppress messages and `/only` to just return logic value. I wrote it yesterday so there may be some problems  and there’s certainly space for improvements. But it works good enough right now.}

Regarding AIR, we used it for game Samorost 3 (development started 5 years ago) and I must say, that I still don't know anything else which I could use for all main (no linux) platforms (at least not when we started and had to decide, what technology to use). Now Haxe is more mature, but still not ready for my need. But true is, that AIR is quite heavy for simple utilities... that's why I use Rebol (v2) every day and follow Red development.^/^/Just quick look at Electron site - it is JS with HTML+CSS = I don't want to touch it and it really cannot be same like AIR.}

They disable decryption for PR builds in case of malicious PRs. Still, I would be concerned about making a mistake and leaking something in the log or build artifacts. It also implies some level of trust of that third-party. I just thought it was interesting, and could be potentially useful}

The CI jobs are queued and depending on the servers load, can be run in a few minutes up to a few hours after the  notification from github, or even time out sometimes (happens more and more often on Travis) because of temporary high load. Basically, they are not very reliable as a daily building backend for binaries.}

It would imply some level of trust of AppVeyor and Travis, and care to avoid accidentally releasing some sensitive information, but it appears that both CI services support that, and will not perform decryption when running PR builds.}

    text: {@mikeparr , I think I might have suggested this before, but it seems to me that the text "Category:" and "Red word:" should not prefix every entry in the respective sections. As it is, I find that they dominate the lines they're on, being large and right at the start. They make it harder to see the intended text on these lines and they just seem redundant being repeated for every entry. ^/It would be better, IMO, to indicate that an entry is part of these sections with some lighter-weight, smaller text that follows the main text you want to be looking at. Another possibility would be to omit the text "Category:" and "Red word:" except for right at the start of the sections, and use a very light background color to indicate the section. Also, think of the ink that could be saved!}

    text: {Quoting has been integrated deeply into the Rebol language through dedicated first-class datatypes (block! vs paren!, lit-word! vs word!, lit-path! vs path!). Beyond those types, the syntactic "quoting" makes no sense, as the values either evaluate to themselves, or denote different semantics (like set-word!, set-path! and any-function!). Anyway, you can always pass quoted values (regardless of their datatype) using lit-word! arguments in functions, or use `quote` when you need to dynamically block a value from evaluating (only useful for word!, path!, paren! and (eventually) any-function! values).}

Am I understanding this correctly? A special execution context is created for processing the macro to keep its "namespace" (for lack of a better term) isolated from the surrounding code.

    text: {@DonaldTsang  Firstly, When you have native code compilation, why would you want a bytecode interpreter? Secondly, parrot was designed to be useful for a wide range of dynamic programming languages and as such neither its design, nor its development went good. Parrot was supposed to be the VM used by perl 6 but because parrot was not good enough due to wrong design decisions as well as it was too slow, hence the perl developers had to move on to other backends like JVM and their own moarvm in the end. (And no, moarvm is also not suited for red as it is built with perl and its object system in mind) . Thirdly, using parrot would make it impossible to use red (r/s) for systems programming which goes against the red's fullstack philosophy. BTW as @dockimbel  asked what is your use case for using other backend than the current one?}

Rust and Haskell bundle mingw with them for the linker and some other stuff.^/^/3.    Also LLVM was created specifically for C-like programming languages hence its optimisations are well-suited for such languages. On the other hand, Red's performance under LLVM would still suffer just like Haskell's. So performance is not any reason to choose LLVM. ^/^/4.    Using LLVM means it becomes more work to support both the interpreter and compiler.^/^/5.    GC options are pretty much limited on LLVM but some work was being done on this recently, i don't know what it's status is right now.^/^/6.    You lose the cross compiling benefits that you have right now in the Red toolchain if you choose LLVM. Cross compiling using llvm and gcc is a mess, just building the cross compiler takes hours. ^/^/7.    Using LLVM would also mean that the easy-to-use android backend to come soon woudn't have been that easy to use.^/^/8.    Using LLVM also means that the red executable is not portable any more. Also it is no longer < 1 mb. ^/^/Also creating asm.js target in the red toolchain is pretty much feasible, so why not do it?}

    text: {@dockimbel It makes sense to have it (from few months) and that’s right it is not so visible (so I am not so stupid) but the good news is that it exists. ^/BTW, I am waiting for the final decision about the PR of the cask. After a  long discussion, I think Homebrew Caskroom members (in coordination with Homebrew members) now understand that Red is an open-source project. They were hesitating since they did not understand first that `red-061` depends currently on Rebol SDK and make install from source impossible or maybe very difficult. I did my best to convince them that soon Red would depend only on Red. When Red can self-bootstrap the cask will become  a formula (since red could be installed from source).  In terms of visibility, `brew search red` redirects to the cask so the visibility is mostly the same as a formula. Another point is that when a formula is source-based, it does not mean that each installation of Red via brew is made by compiling the source. It would be the same as copying the red binary. ^/I’ll try the idea to install red-latest from a tap. After, if you agree, you could then create (after my test) a tap repository `Homebrew-red` where to put the cask and the formula as we wish since a tap does not rely on HB and HBC members. A tap is maybe good also in terms of visibility since people can check on Github every repo with name of the form `Homebrew-*` dedicated to tap.}

    text: {FYI, I have changed the default behavior of pattern-matching macros, so existing code will not work. Please have a look at the related [commit](https://github.com/red/red/commit/38dd528bc001656d6a009f32cbc06b8db7c7f391) and updated [documentation](https://doc.red-lang.org/preprocessor.html#macro). Basically, by default now, pattern-matching macros returned value is replacing the matched pattern (similar to named macros). You can get back the old behavior by inserting a `[manual]` attribute in the macro spec.}

    text: {@dockimbel, I think your proposal is sound, but also want to make sure you think it's a *good* idea, and fits in the larger Red design picture comfortably. ^/^/@WiseGenius, the big issue with using `hash!` is the creation aspect, correct? e.g. we want to be able to extend a hash by adding new elements as we find them in a JSON stream. If that's the only issue, it's simple enough, in this case, to collect the data in a block and convert it to a hash once the structure is closed. To handle streaming conversions, the loader could still emit that it's a hash! coming to the consumer.}

    text: {@WiseGenius @greggirwin Yes, you can store `none` values in blocks, though, when creating an implicit key/value store using a block, if `none` is an allowed value, then all the lookups become more verbose, as you need to search for the key first, and then decide if it is worth retrieving the value or not. It is also error-prone as `none` can have two opposite meanings ("not found" or valid result), I've been bitten in the past in my early Rebol projects with such approach, and I'm avoiding it totally since then. Another disadvantage is that the "key has no value associated" information becomes more expensive to record and manipulate if it needs to appear as an entry in the block/map instead of just being absent:^/```lisp^/list: [^/    a: none^/    b: none^/    c: none^/    d: none^/    ...thousands of similar entries...^/    word: 1^/]^/```^/vs:^/```lisp^/list: [^/    word: 1^/]^/```}

    text: {@dockimbel , @qtxie - late to the party. Sorry for confusion (wrong word) re "counterpart" to `put`. In fact what I meant was - If we can have a special word for setting a value `put`, we could come up with some word to remove a key, which in fact could be a shortcut to setting a map value to `none`. I am not doubting special `map`advantages. Would having such a func to remove map key go against how `map`is envisioned to work? I think not?}

    text: {`to bitset! <integer>` is forbidden in R2, and in R3 it is equivalent to `make bitset! <integer>`There is no need for the facility in this form (duplication), and it is confusing because `to bitset! <char>` sets the bit corresponding to the number value, and `to bitset! <list>` also sets the bits corresponding to the numbers in the list. So I would suggest either to have the implementation which sets the bit, or to forbid it.}

The real issue here is that we don't have a documentation for it yet, and that newcomers make wrong assumptions based on the `hash` name. So, a new name could avoid that, though, naming datatype in Rebol world is notoriously hard.}

Blocks too slow now, just change to `hash!`. Sounds great. Is that Red's goal? If so, what is the cost? Could `keys-of/words-of` work on blocks? Sure, though the results may not always make sense. Can you think of `map!` as a series in *some* ways? Yes. In *all*? Not really.^/^/If we accept that map, block, object, hash, etc. are different, and have different interfaces, it will make some things harder, others easier. It does mean you may have to think a little more at times, which I'm not opposed to.^/^/WRT JSON null values, I think it just means that `map!` is probably a bad fit for JSON objects. They may seem convenient, but if we have to hack around `none!` values, it's not worth it. Just use objects. I'll revert my JSON lib to do that unless @dockimbel says maps are the way to go, and offers a solution that fits Red in his mind.}

Different API is required when the datatype semantics differ too much from other ones. For map!, keys need special care wrt casing which cannot be covered by most series actions. Also, map! enforces a key/value structure, so a modifying action like `put` (as a counter-part to `select`) is welcome. `put` also works on `any-block!` values. `set` and `get` are supported by map, because they allow for the convenient path notation to be used to represent `<map>/<key>`.

If searching for a value was always expected to succeed, then an error would have been appropriate on failure, but that is not the case. Returning `none` allows to signal a `specific` resulting state without disrupting the execution flow. That is also why `none` is considered the same as `false` in conditional expressions, this leads to short and elegant code patterns in Rebol languages.}

The content of the blocks was irrelevant, and was just representing 2 generic blocks of code.^/The point of my example was that if JSON's `null` has been converted to the `word!` `none` (as in rebolek's example above it) instead of a `none!` value, then it will be seen as `true` in expressions instead of `false`. This is undesirable, but not a big deal.^/The main problem we were discussing, is that if JSON's `null` is converted to a `none!` value, then the key is removed from the `map!`. This is not the only reason that I'm saying that `map!`s shouldn't behave this way. Setting keys values to `unset!` is what should remove them from the `map!`. Ironically, the current implementation allows `map!` keys to have `unset!` values, but that's probably a mistake. Sorry if my English is too lazily concise. Do I need to elaborate on anything else I explained in the discussion above?}

    text: {@dockimbel , @qtxie I just checked in a [powershell script](https://github.com/dander/chocolatey-packages/tree/master/automatic/red) which can be used to produce a Chocolatey package given a red executable. It assumes Chocolatey tools and Powershell (at least 3.0 I believe) are available. It doesn't yet have the capability to upload the package to the Chocolatey repository, but that would be pretty easy to add. It just involves setting a user token in a secure variable on the CI configuration, but I haven't worked out how that works yet, and wanted to check with you guys before figuring that out.^/^/One detail that would need to be determined is the version format for these packages. Including a hyphen in the name implies that it is a pre-release version, so Chocolatey will ignore it unless you specify the --pre flag. Otherwise, it is treated as slightly lower value than the same version number without any hyphens. I think the existing 1.0.<build counter> number with '-alpha' or '-beta' appended seems pretty sensible.^/^/The upshot of doing this is that it makes it pretty easy to keep red updated (while staying in the path) with the command `cup red --pre`}

    text: {@greggirwin My JSON codec equates Red's `none` with JSON's `null`. But there is a problem with doing this, because `map!` keys set to `none` are removed.^/For example, when writing to CouchDB's "_replicator", I want to send a document with the following field:^/```^/^-"user_ctx": {^/^-^-"name": null,^/^-^-"roles": []^/^-}^/```^/But in Red:^/```^/^-"user_ctx" #(^/^-^-"name" #[none]^/^-^-"roles" []^/^-)^/```^/immediately becomes:^/```^/^-"user_ctx" #(^/^-^-"roles" []^/^-)^/```^/So I get back:^/```^/#(^/^-"error" "forbidden"^/^-"reason" "The given `user_ctx.name' is not valid"^/)^/```^/I haven't tested your codec for this yet, but from a quick glance of the code, I suspect it does this too?^/There are 2 things I'm initially thinking:^/ 1. Should the JSON codec use something other than `#[none]` to represent `null` (such as the `word!` `none` or `null`)?^/ 2. Should Red's `map!` not behave this way, and instead accept `#[none]` as a legitimate value (which has been frequently suggested before)?^/^/I'm leaning towards 2. However, both 1 and 2 would break a lot of my existing code, so I'm not in a hurry to get this fixed any time soon. ;)}

So the above expr would take 1-3 'hellos, an optional 'red, and 1 'world, in any order. *Way* more complicated, but your need of `opt` made my brain head down the long path of generalization.}

Their approaches are both very high level though, where Red is building from the ground up, so you have consistency all the way down. Of course people will want XML and JSON libs in Red, and we need to enable interop, but what only Red seems to be addressing (of those 3) is the huge gain from simplifying things.}

Implementing a Eve-like environment on top of Red is not a big deal. The question is more: what parts of Eve are really relevant and improve our productivity/efficiency? Eve has still to demonstrate in real world that such model is "better" than existing ones. Ability to have an accurate mental model of how your tool is working is AFAICT, an important part of programming. Red pervasive DSLs approach is trying to help on that by specializing the tools by domain and reducing the cognitive load required to build that mental model for each one.}

Moreover, it also enables extra verbose outputs, for parts of the runtime where `verbose` is set to a value > 0 (e.g. for [interpreter](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/runtime/interpreter.reds#L88), or [parse](https://github.com/red/red/blob/master/runtime/parse.reds#L14)).

I did an FSM dialect many years ago and built a few versions where I generated code before I realized I didn't need to generate code. I could just interpret the spec dynamically and directly. I think building a protocol dialect, that uses an FSM dialect could be great. Those two concepts are in a lot of what we do, but they are implicit, spread out, and not truly specified in our code.^/^/I always wanted more of Rebol to be written in Rebol, which is part of why I like Red so much. But I think we can go even further, as they seem to be trying to do. The TCP stuff looks like a combination of Forth and Lisp concepts, which is also what I think makes Red powerful. }

    text: {I have just merged libRed branch to master. The toolchain now behaves differently, so here is a brief overview:^/1. Compilation of Red scripts now has two modes: development and release.^/2. Development mode (or just "dev mode") is the default one, release mode is achieved with an extra `-r` or `--release` compilation option.^/3. Dev mode will first build the Red runtime as a shared library (libRedRT) and reuse it across compilations. It will put it in the working folder, along with some other temporary libRedRT* files. You can freealy delete them at any time.^/4. Dev mode provides much faster compilation time, by compiling only user code and not the Red runtime library.^/5. If your Red scripts contains R/S code and relies on Red runtime API, you should compile once with `-u` option, to force a custom update of libRedRT (takes a bit of time), then you can compile as usual and enjoy fast compilation too.^/6. Pure R/S scripts are unaffected by those changes, so they are handled as usual.^/^/There are still some details we need to work on, but it is already very usable as is.}

Free ranging evaluation doesn't always give you clues about arg application, though you can use parens if you want. And as you write more Red, you'll find yourself building up lines like this step by step. ^/Notes:^/- We could use `copy/part` after using random on the series, but that's an extra copy we don't need. If that's clearer to you, there's nothing wrong in doing it that way. ^/- Instead, we use `clear` in combination with `at`. `At` specifies an offset in the series and `clear` removes everything after that.^/- Series! indexes are 1-based. `Size + 1` is used to start clearing just past the number of items we want.^/- `Clear` returns the new tail of the cleared series, but we want to return the `head` of it.}

    text: {@wolframkriesing_twitter Welcome! Email! and tag! datatypes were added in the current master branch, we mark then as done in the "Road to 1.0" only when released officially. Note that in the "0.6.2 LibRed" card, they are marked as done though. To answer your other questions:^/*1) how can it be so tiny?*^/It is mostly because we have no external dependencies other than the OS (with exception to libCurl on Unix platform until 0.7.0). We've built our own toolchain and runtime library implementing only what is really needed. Moreover, as the toolchain is coded in Rebol, it is a testimony of how productive and efficient Rebol languages are. ;-)^/*2) How hard will it be to keep red up to date, when going so low-level? E.g. when a new MacOSX, Android, etc. version comes out, how much effort will red require to catch up?*^/We rely mostly on core OS APIs which are not changing between OS versions to another, so I can't recall we had to change anything inside our code because of a new OS update. Basically, if an OS will change its core API enough to break Red compatibility, you can expect most other software on that platform will be broken too, so unlikely to happen, except for major OS changes (like MacOS 9 => OS X).}

    text: {@wolframkriesing_twitter, welcome! All Bolek said +1.^/^/The tiny size comes from its Forth heritage, an elegant design, and much discussion about what is worth including. On the one hand, having "batteries included" in modern parlance, makes it widely usable without external dependencies. On the other, the more batteries we include, the bigger it gets. It's also a decision about what to write in Red/System, which may be more verbose, versus how much of Red is written in Red, which may impact performance. A tough balancing act to be sure.^/^/The finale of the balancing act, which is part of your second question, is that Red is a self-contained toolchain. Huge benefits there, but also means that new back ends will increase the size of the standard runtime. There will surely be options to omit it, as Rebol had the /base interpreter option, but Red has a clean architecture WRT platforms, targets, an formats. Keeping these up-to-date will affect some layers more than others. The ELF and PE formats aren't going to change. ARM and IA-32 targets are stable, but may get optimizations. GUIs and mobile OSs are moving targets. Much work there, but Red gives us a huge advantage in being self-contained, with a full cross-compiler. And all that is there today.}

    text: {### Future workflow?^/I'd like to talk about 2 languages which handles "looping" very much the way I like. They have quite different implementations tho^/#### Julia^/Is very similar to redbol. Has 2 [words](http://julia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/control-flow/#man-loops) `for` and `while` and uses a range syntax `start:optional_step:end`. For is nicely combined with [comprehensions](http://julia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/arrays/#comprehensions). It all works well for upto 2-3 dimensions. For higher ones you have to explicitly reshape^/#### J^/Is very much different. It transparently handles the cases for multiple dimensions. The basic operator for ranges is `i.` so for example, `i. 2 _5` gives^/```^/4 3 2 1 0^/9 8 7 6 5^/```^/It doesn't have explicit looping, but uses other simple operators to get the result you want. It is an extreme case of trying to simplify things (which I personally like)^/## Use case^/The motivation for this seems to be to ease adoption for people from other programming languages? I think @PeterWAWood and @Arie-vw raises raises good points. Would this help adoption like @greggirwin says or introduce more complexities? I'm more inclined to agree with Ptere here. I myself am a bit conflicted. I'd still use `loop`, but perhaps `for` for most others, and then functions to operate on collections}

    text: {(sorry for the length)^/**Edit**: After writing all this, I realized this may be a design for a range construct? (mentioned in http://curecode.org/rebol3/ticket.rsp?id=1993) If so, there seems to be 2 goals here:^/1. Cater for programmers from other languages^/2. Design a range construct^/^/# Original:^/I like the proposal overall, gregg has put in all the features that I'd probably want. (Except for some like looping over collections `map-each`, `foreach`,  multidimensional arrays, .. :tongue: ). That said, would I use it? My intuition is.. probably not.. except to use some of the features (like rebol `for`). I want to ignore the syntax and talk about the semantics (is that the right word?) for the moment.^/## Symantics^/### Current workflow^/I tend to to work with series functional programming style, directly working on the data / collection type if possible. I do use `loop` and sometimes `repeat`, but it's mostly `foreach` and `collect` if there already is data (`series`) to work on. I miss `map-each` and `fold` being built-in. Handling collections may be out of scope for this?^/>The idea is to support mainly numeric loop constructs. Working like foreach and forskip is also possible^/^/#### Advantages of a single `word!` for looping^/I'll be easily able to refactor my code from `loop` to `repeat` to `for` without changing the syntax much (Hmm.. would that be as easy as I think it is?)}

    text: {@TimeSlip Routines are what you want. You declare them in Red code, the argument specification is like for Red function (except limited to one type per argument), but the locals and body block are pure R/S. Red will marshal some types that have direct correspondance between Red and R/S, and for the rest, you get `red-*` structures used by Red runtime library internally to implement Red types using R/S. Then, you need to learn from the existing examples, the Red internal API, so you can manipulate those structures.}

The developer audience voted with their feet;  they don't much care for free-form expressions which read like a bowl of word-soup.

I (and a few others) are thinking the IDE might ease much of the slope - that's where I was coming from with the earlier comment.  There was also earlier talk of a beginner's or training-wheels-included variant.  I don't know exactly how that would work but if any language can pull it off it would probably be red with the imaginative red-team.  Rebol has a number of words which may improve readability (a worthwhile goal) for experienced programmers but mainly add to the thicket for others, especially newbies.  I learned "unless" because it was in the table of control words and never thought about how it was redundant...or non-essential.  The whole 'to-" series of words is, I believe, similar...they add NOTHING in function but arguably improve readability.  The cost?  IMO, 20+ words of sheer distracting *noise* for the person who is trying rebol on....   It's sort of like instead of learning C++ and then sampling libraries you need to learn C++ PLUS all the libraries at the same time....except worse in that the word nature of rebol tends to elevate everything to the same level of prominence.   Anyway, I'm a big fan of red (as I was of Forth) even though I am, and fear I may remain for some time, "only an egg".}

    text: {@TimeSeriesLord et al.  As with Forth, Rebol encouraging so many words on top of words is a two edged sword.  It tends to encourage a tower of Babel and the lack of obvious distinction between foundation words and pure syntactic sugar (e.g., "unless") tends to make learning a lot more intimidating.  It would be nice if non-essential words could be somehow easily distinguished.  Maybe a color distinction in the built in IDE?  Anyway, it is one of my worries about red getting the acceptance it deserves.}

Lisp and Forth are prominently noted, and Logo as well, which I think of as a bridge between the two in some ways. It eliminates Lisp's parens, uses the term *word* heavily, and focuses on building  up vocabularies and explore like Forth. ^/^/REBOL borrows implementation elements from both as well, though they are quite different.^/^/It's nice, and a little funny to me, when I see some of REBOL's ideas (which may have been independently discovered elsewhere as well) show up in other languages.

There are many ways to get results. ^/^/The best bit about REBOL and Red has been having your own custom dictionary of words (functions, parsesets) to do work and solve programming challenges according to how you think and see things rather than how a typical language designer saw things when he designed his syntax and what have you.^/^/That is what makes REBOL and now Red special. Both embrace the Chuck Moore philosophy of a virtual computer controlled by one's own custom dictionary. ^/^/^/And that is why a better way to use REBOL and Red is simply to write your own dictionary atop the standard. For that reason, there is little reason to pollute the standard with superfluous words like has been done with `unless`. `Unless` would be useful if REBOL and Red lacked `not`.^/^/Only today, after seeing a tangled mess of a script on Rebol.org, I wrote my own version of what that other writer had been trying to achieve. I did so by leveraging `parse`. Yet, to someone else, my well-documented code (see my github) might seem a mess.^/^/All the same, `unless` is a stupid word in the standard. It's a language wart.

    text: {There are a number of articles that discuss binding in Rebol, and its model of definitional scoping.  Red mimics it very closely, though may differ in some details. Here's how you can write `use` in Red, as a quick stub:^/```^/use: func [^/^-"Defines words local to a block evaluation."^/^-vars [block!] "Words local to the block"^/^-body [block!] "Block to evaluate"^/][^/^-; R3: apply make closure! reduce [to block! vars copy/deep body] []^/^-; Renaud Gombert's simple approach^/^-do has vars body^/]^/```}

And our code for pre-allocating the block is almost identical. :^^) I go back and forth about whether I think `/into` is a good thing. While I like the idea of control (and, indeed, an HOF accumulator model comes up in more and more things I look at), it adds this small element of complexity *everywhere*. It means that, if we want consistency, *every* series function should support it, right? And that means every new series function I write should also support it. And it's not hard to get it wrong (IMO). It also means all calling code has the optional `/into`,  which adds another thing you can get wrong.}

    text: {@Cthutu @meijeru About the addition operator behavior for vector/vector and vector/scalar, it is just how it was implemented, the precise semantics are not defined yet, it's open to debate about which behavior is the most helpful. In contrast to most other datatypes, vector! has  appeared only in Rebol3 and was never really finished, so it needs additional design work, especially wrt to math operations. Note also that we plan to add a matrix! datatype based on vector!, so this would need to be taken into account too. ^/For the vector math ops, there are two aspects colliding: a) Vectors are series, so mutable. The usual rule is to mutate the series when applying a transformation, so that immutability can be manually controlled through `copy` usage. b) Maths operations apply only on scalar values (so mostly immutable, except for pseudo-scalars like pair!, tuple! and typeset!) in Redbol world.}

    text: {`system/codecs` is a map of `object!`. `encode`and `decode`are the interface, but nothing is preventing us to have parameters block! in it. Ie: like a table of type / encoding or type / decoding pairs used by the interface. Or something like this. There could also be utility functions in the object to help parameterized the encoding/decoding.^/So you will use `system/codecs/json/parameterize/decoding [what you want]` (where `parameterize` is the func and `\decoding`a refinment). Just a rought idea.}

    text: {`load|save/as` is Red's extensible codec mechanism. It can be anything, but there is only dispatch to `encode|decode` funcs, so extra control isn't possible today. It wouldn't be hard to make the codec info a dialected block though, so default formatting could be just the name and a block would mean the name was the first one, and the codec gets the rest of the block as an arg. Cleaner than trying to add `system/options` in an extensible way.}

It should be up to the user to write their own function for pre-converting the unrecognized datatypes depending again on what the data is about.^/I regret that my version of the codec I sent you is currently too permissive in accepting datatypes in this direction. That was a mistake which I intend to fix in future versions.^/Here's what I think should be accepted by default when converting to JSON:^/^/Keys:^/ *^-`string!`^/^/Values:^/ *^-`string!`^/ *^-`integer!`^/ *^-`float!`^/ *^-`map!`^/ *^-`block!`^/ *^-`logic!`^/ *^-`none!`^/^/In this direction, I can understand an option to allow `object!`s, in which case `word!`s would be converted to `string!`s.^/However, I doubt that `word!` keys in `map!`s should be automatically accepted by default since they can clash with `string!`s keys in `map!`s.^/I could even understand a future option to `mold` all keys and values and then convert those `string!`s to JSON strings when `save`ing to JSON, and reversing the process when `load`ing from JSON, but again I think only the simple way above should be done for now. Let's see how often people actually use such fancy functions in Red before building them into the codec. I suspect unique custom functions will be much more common than that one, but I don't know for sure. And as you've already pointed out, extra options as refinements on `save` and `load` would be awkward.}

IMHO, `object!`s are not a good match for JSON, and if someone wants to `load` JSON as `object!`s, they should use an extra step, converting `string!`-key's to `word!`s. If they wrote the data from Red, then they probably know the keys are`word!`-friendly.^/If they're not sure that the keys are `word!`-friendly, then they probably shouldn't be using `object!`s anyway. If they still want to, then they probably have a special use case and therefore would probably want to write their own function to handle the keys and convert the `map!`s themselves anyway.^/In fact, I expect that it would be common to write custom converter functions to and from the `map!`s produced by the JSON codec, depending on what the JSON data represents and how one wants to map that data to Red datatypes. I don't think it's appropriate to try to make the codec do everything. I think simplicity is best here.}

Lossless would mean always returning a map, and always strings as keys. Encoding objects can always be lossless. To ask for lossless decoding, we could leverage the existing `/all` refinement.^/- Lossy conversion is subject to conditions like, but not limited to, those @WiseGenius noted above. If you need detailed control (e.g. keys with spaces should have spaces replaced with an alternate character, invalid conversions are handled by...something, etc.). Detailed control is beyond what `load` could comfortably support in its interface.^/- Why would we even consider a lossy codec? Because it can make things so much nicer. If lossless is our only option, *any* Red code that has to deal with JSON loaded data will either have to use a separate step (which may be included in Red, and generalized) to get detailed control of the codec, or use the noisier syntax required for string key access.^/- The question of defaults depends on what percentage of JSON data we think will be problematic (can't find statistics on that :^^). It will likely be common that Red is both the producer and consumer, hence in complete control, and JSON is just used to talk to a web service, document store DB, etc. The issue, though, is Red's generality. As much as I want details hidden, and to get Red-friendly results by default, my gut instinct is that the codec needs to be lossless, with extra steps to wordify keys and convert to objects. :^^(}

    text: {@dockimbel I tried reversing the order of the generated table for `uppercase`, and it only improved some of the characters:^/```^/red>> uppercase "βεθιπρςφω"^/== "ΒϵΘιϖϱςΦΩ"^/```^/The choice of which ones this did and didn't fix doesn't seem to be caused by their order in the table, since both ϐ and ϵ appear after both Β and Ε, yet Β is fixed this way and Ε isn't. I'm sure if I read the rest of the code properly, I'd see the reason. Or maybe I made a mistake somewhere.^/It might be possible to achieve success, as you say, by rearranging both the order of the table and/or some other part of the code.^/If this doesn't work (and if the concern about a second table is the size of the code), it might be possible to split the existing table into 2 smaller tables:^/The first table would only have one-to-one, 2-way relationships for uppercase and lowercase. For example, it would contain this line:^/```^/0392h 03B2h ; GREEK CAPITAL LETTER BETA^/```^/And the other table would contain the other 1-way relationships. For example, it would contain this line:^/```^/03D0h 03B2h ; GREEK BETA SYMBOL^/```^/So `uppercase` would just go --> through the 2nd table, and then go <-- through the 1st table.^/And `lowercase` would just go --> through the 2nd table, and then go --> through the 1st table.^/Of course, this wouldn't cover everything, but I assume we're only talking about a temporary improvement for now, since handling unicode properly could take a lot of work and is not something which should be skimped on in the long run.^/Final Sigma is the least of our worries. I would just put it in the second table for now:^/```^/03C2h 03C3h ; GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA^/03A2h 03A3h ; <reserved-03A2>^/```^/`lowercase "Σ"` would still become `"σ"` at the end of a word (as it does currently), but that's fine (simple and predictable) for now. However, `uppercase "ς"` would also become `"Σ"` as it should (and doesn't currently).^/At the very least, it seems strange to me that `=` seems to use `uppercase` when `lowercase` is currently more reliable (having it's own table).}

But because it's super strict (no loadable code), it's quite different as well. Everything is async, so doing anything sync is a bit of work. The idea of a cooperative scheduler, using one thread per CPU core, is kind of a standard model now. Nice that actors only have a 256 byte overhead, so are very lightweight. Of course, the more you can lock things down, the more the compiler can optimize.}

I can better understand the rationale for some of the decisions in red (and perhaps r3?) Perhaps it is important for other newcomers to know this too? But, on the other hand, there is a *lot* of content (literature, code, libraries) for rebol2, and there is the tendency to get overwhelmed? Partly caused by the different approaches taken by different groups (this in particular caused by the flexibility offered by rebol and lack(?) of a central package management system)}

One way to do it is making a bitwise 'and' with mask 2147483647. Create a function which takes as parameter an integer! and returns a smaller range unsigned value. Use that function where you need it.}

About his `collect` question, the basic form is `collect body` which as no consistency issues whatsover. `/into` is a refinement for providing an optional aggregation series, instead of having a block created by `collect`, so the refinement's argument follows the mandatory ones, that is  how it works for all functions in Rebol languages, so it's fully consistent. The examples he showed have no need for a `/into` refinement, the basic `collect` was enough. I think he was trying to understand `collect` by focusing on the meaning of the function and refinement names, rather than the semantics.}

Where `map-each` collects the result of the body block's evaluation. i.e., `map-each` is easily implemented with collect like this:^/^/```^/map-each: function [^/^-"Evaluates body for each value in a series, returning all results."^/^-'word [word! block!] "Word, or words, to set on each iteration"^/^-data [series!] ; map!^/^-body [block!]^/][^/^-collect [foreach :word data [keep/only do body]]^/]^/^/```^/^/But you can do anything in your `collect` body, without any iteration at all. I think of `collect` as a way to gather things into a result without having to track the series I'm appending into. e.g., in your example code you have a `final` series you append into, but I don't see it defined. As you change code, it's easy to put things in the wrong place, or to have to repeat the series name in every `append` call. `collect` helps with that. ^/^/I should add that I very rarely use `/into`, and my original design used a set-word! rather than the implicit `keep` function. I still have my old one, which I now call `collect-each`.^/}

    text: {I have to agree with @greggirwin that having `/into` everywhere wouldn't look very nice. In rebol I never had memory problems, probably meaning that the GC was doing a good job. I started using `/into` with Red to lower memory consumption. Althought I like having control and the cleaness of it, I wonder if in most cases the GC should take care of memory use. So mixed feeling here.. I guess I wouldn't use it if not forced to, but would use it extensively if writing an app for some IOT device with limited memory.}

That is, if you're writing code that needs this, you may need it everywhere, which means having `/into` everywhere in your code. Of course, you can reverse the argument and say that will make calls that don't use it stand out. ^/^/Some time back I looked at the idea of transducers in Clojure, and I think that came partly from this kind of need. }

It's one of those "gut feeling" things.^/^/Having an accumulator func, and saying that's the optimized approach, is one idea, but I'm not thrilled with that. It does make it clear that you're writing code with that need in mind, but also might be less Reddish and not mix as cleanly with other code from a style standpoint.^/^/So I imagine what code might look like that uses `/into`, just making stuff up. e.g.^/```^/collect/into [^/    foreach rec recs [^/        compose/into [extract/into blk wd buff] buff^/    ] buff^/]^/```^/And asking whether I like that, or how else would I do it. I also wonder if, as a design pattern (because if Red does it as standard, everyone else should too), it works well, or if people will look  at doc strings and think they *should* use it, even if they don't need it. i.e., it becomes a widely advertised "feature".}

If we had datatype alias names, it could be both, but then you also have the issue of extra path name accessors. Something we could work around to some extent at the mezz level. ^/^/The `1..2` range notation has come up, and I used it in my `bounds` and `range` dialects, but it's a hack on `tuple!` which is fun, but limited. We will also want IPv6 addresses at some point. And `1::2` almost looks like it has little corners of a box between the values.^/^/I try to think of the different ways we can use what we have now, their limitations (e.g. byte ranges and 12 segments on tuples), and what the most useful things might be in our ever-tightening lexical space (or do we consider Unicode for some things?)^/^/Ren is always on my mind as well of course.}

So, the toolchain code is BSD-3 and the runtime library (included in all compiled Red programs) is BSL. Basically, if you just use Red toolchain (in binary or source form) to write code in Red, you don't have to do anything and you're free to do whatever you want with the source or compiled code you wrote. If you distribute a derivative version of the Red toolchain, you have to include the licenses files unchanged. That's all. ;-)}

I did put "variables" in quotes, because Red does NOT have variables in the sense you may be accustomed to. It is important to grasp the notion of "binding" in Red, to which you can find copious references in earlier parts of this chat.}

    text: {@gour We code on Windows 7, I use Textpad mostly, and Sublime2. Qtxie is using Everedit. Though, Notepad would be fine too. ;-) I could code Red on any OS, though, for native GUI work, you really need a native OS instance, a VM is sometimes not accurate enough (visual glitches, timing issues, etc...). Another reason is because of great tools like IDA Pro, which work best on Windows. We don't code on laptops, as they are not fast enough, we use small desktops with 4Ghz+ i7 and 16GB of RAM to be able to run several VMs at the same time. We also have a couple of RaspberryPi for testing/debugging ARM code (QEMU is not good enough for that).}

No association with original prototype object is stored, so if you want it from the ID, you need to store the associations yourself.}

When you create a function, the body block is just *a block*, behaving exactly the same way as the block in the example above. The only difference is that some words will be bound to the function context, instead of the surrounding context. So, if we use the above block as a function body, you'll get the exact same behavior:^/```lisp^/foo: func [/local s][[s: "" append s "a"]^/foo^/== "a"^/^/body-of :foo^/== [s: "a" append s "a"]^/:foo^/== func [/local s][s: "a" append s "a"]^/```}

    text: {@dockimbel thanks for the follow-ups,  I wasn't around yesterday anymore. I did homoiconic languages before (as in CL, Clojure, Racket, Scheme, Picolisp), so I'm fine with the notion of "code is data". Reading your reddit post I think the biggest difference is variables vs. bindings. Even in lisps if you write `(let ((foo "")))` inside a function definition it will behave as `foo: copy ""` in Red. So I guess in lisps I would read it "set this local variable to an empty string", whereas I don't know how would I say it in Red. One is used to having a function definition static whereas here if you look into the body you suddenly see that the definition itself changed. It's like the function can mutate itself, which I haven't seen in any other language. Now that I know it though I'll try to remember it.^/^/Just out of curiosity though, is this behavior a direct result of the language's design? Does the design *bind* you to keep it this way? Or could both concepts be used but Carl decided this one has more benefits? If so what are those benefits?}

So, everything you are looking at in a Rebol or Red source is *only* data, not code. Therefore, there are not such thing as "initializating", `ret: []` just makes the word `ret` refer to the value following it (empty block in this case). If you modify that block, next time you evaluate that expression, `ret` will be set to the same block, with whatever it currently holds. So, a dynamic construction is required in such case (achieved by `make block! 0` for example), rather than using a literal block value, unless you want to use it for caching values across calls (similar effect as a *static* allocation in other languages). Longer explanation in this [/r/redlang post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redlang/comments/4ecs9n/insane_behavior_in_rebol_lets_put_an_end_to_this/d2lt4fi) (using string instead of a block, but both are series, so behave the same).}

Localization should be a representation concern, but not a code representation one. I.e. one can have options to print a date value in localized format but in order to store it for later reloading one should use the tools (functions) that are designed for that.}

    text: {@pekr @tanstaaf1  I think it would be good to have some locale support. To support things like Turkish uppercase i, "," as a decimal separator and, even dates. However, I believe providing location support is going to be very difficult in Red as values are so fundamental to the language. Clearly, it is difficult, if not impossible, to "localise" the Rebol values. If the literal (or molded) values are localised and then become ambiguous, how would you know under which "locale" they had been molded. For example, if Rebol allowed "," to be used as a decimal separator in addition to ".",  does 123,456 mean 123456.00 or 123.456? You cannot tell without knowing under which "locale" the numeric literal was created. }

    text: {If you tell me the meaning of 7/6/2016 I can adapt so we can communicate.  Why isn't it reasonable to tell rebol the meaning and have *it* adapt?   This could be done with a config, a header line, or maybe a refinement?   It's an ambiguous case, obviously, so there is no perfect answer - I'm just suggesting there are *better* answers than what rebol is doing.   Part of a better answer is that when the interpreter chokes on an input it should give some more useful suggestion than what R2 currently gives it could, for example, improve the status quo considerably by merely saying "Input does not fit dd/mm/yy format." when presented with 12/25/16.   Country of origin of the communication would also help suggest an interpretation (that is part of context in human communication).   Also, why can't both "Dec 25 2016" and "25 Dec 2016" be understood instead of just one?   I don't claim to have all the perfect answer here, @greggirwin.   I'm mostly saying that the current answer isn't too hot and AT LEAST the error messages red might offer should strive to be better than those given by R2.  I'm bringing this up now in the hope that it might help lead to something a little better.  R2 brags about how "flexible" it is in handling dates...but it is, in fact, not so flexible ... not so well thought out... at all.   How else could this be handled?  I pointed out the ambiguity so it would at least be considered.  If the US and China were insignificant countries in the programming arena we might just disregard them.   My guess is the US + China are rather more influential in the tech arena than the rest of the world combined. In any case, the ambiguity *is* going to cause a lot of grief which might be diminished by at least acknowledging the problem and attempting something different.}

If there's a good rationale, and explanation, that will need to be out there, as with operator precedence. That's confusing to new people, but it has a solid rationale behind it by reducing cognitive load. Non-promoting math, I think, will add that, because you have to keep careful track of types, or cast to ensure consistent behavior. }

    text: {A quick note on the inner part of `map`, since it may not be clear how it works to those new to Red. ^/It may look like variadic (variable arity, or a func that takes a variable number of args) magic, but it's not. You can use any func that takes *up to* the number of args `map` passes it when it does^/```^/keep/only fn series/:i :i :series^/```^/The only magic here is that when `fn` is called, it will consume as many arguments as it needs (this is how Red's free-ranging evaluation works) and return its result for `keep` to consume. Any args `fn` doesn't consume are evaluated but then just ignored and not used. If your func (`fn`) takes *more* args than expected, the end of the `repeat` body block is hit and you will get an error that your func didn't get enough args.}

    text: {Max, I mostly agree. But if you've ever used `collect+foreach` you've effectively used `map`, right? And if you've used `remove-each` you've done the inverse of `filter`. I'm totally with you that blocks are nicer than lambdas in most cases.  That said, functional is widely accepted now, even if only a few people are really good at it. From a marketing standpoint, having those things there will be good, and show that Red can do everything they can do.^/It's also like my argument for `for`. Once they're in, they see that `loop` and `repeat` are nicer when you just need int-based loops going forward. }

That may be OK for enforcing shorter expressions (though you can always predefine the body), and I know there is currently no other way to get the removal count.^/One option would be a `/count` refinement, though that might be confusing. It may look like you *only* want to count matching items, rather than removing them and returning the count. Another option is a `count-each` function.^/```^/count-each: function [^/^-"Evaluates body for each value(s) in a series, returning a count of true results."^/^-'word [word!] "Word, or words, to set on each iteration"^/^-data [block!] ^/^-body [block!]^/][^/^-n: 0^/^-foreach :word data [if do body [n: n + 1]]^/^-n^/]^/;count-each a [1 2 3] [odd? a]^/```^/A separate func means processing the series twice if you want both results. I don't think returning both the series and count, even though the result could be destructured, is a good idea, because it still complicates chaining.}

Anyway, I like that Red is starting out simple, like R2. Small scripts are as important as large, and the way it works now is a good fit there, IMO. For PitL, we all know more needs to be done. I hope we'll get more people experimenting and posting ideas of how it might all work.}

    text: {@tanstaaf1 @greggirwin @pekr - Thanks for your view on this matter. It is somewhat frustrating when you talk to fellow devs about the power and uniqueness of Redbol. I mean, being able to write a compiler in Rebol - a language which was developed almost 20 years ago - speaks volumes about its unique abilities. I was wondering, after having read Ladislavs' and @dockimbel advanced articles abour the inner workings of Redbol, whether it is possible to use breakpoints and probe etc. to build a tool with which anybody can delve into the deeper stuff. For instance, keeping a log of chances to each word, even if it issues an error. This will help me a lot. I can use the entries as a basis to tap Docs' and others'  minds.^/ Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like this. Just a thought, This can serve as a future reference of where people struggle and workarounds.  Even posting the current nuggets posted on gitter  there, and maybe discussing it futher.^/^/All this on a public accessible site - like an tuned down IDE of sorts.}

This is a pity as such form would be useful for dialects, so if we want to allow it but withouth breaking email syntax too much. Therefore we need a new datatype, as such syntactic form can be used to represent many things: a name, a label, a location, an annotation, etc... It would act as email!, no special semantics, just evaluates to itself, so very quick to implement.}

    text: {@dockimbel let me go through old notes and chat on altme for `ref!`.  One of the issues in Rebol, no pun intended, with issue! becoming a word, was the effect on symbol table space. I think that's what led to the hybrid model. A similar question exists for `ref!`. If we assume they'll be used as handles for users, only the largest systems probably need to worry if they are symbols. And maybe that's not an issue at all in Red. If we use them for things like cross-reference locations and more general markers, there could be a lot. Then you have to weigh the benefits of each (storage, lookup speed, etc.) and we may just need to note limitations for people to be aware of.}

The code might NOT be optimal usage of the GUI engine, so sorry, if I messed things. The script is short and basically uses a long base face, placed at the right border of the screen, so scroll to the left by changing its x coordinate. When I set the base face transparent, I can see rather smooth experience (well, with few slow downs/speed ups, but the text is readable). But then I removed the bg color transparency and got the following experience: http://2zone.cz/pekr/red-news-scroller-flicker.mp4 (Win10 here)}

They do have an interior language, which doesn't seem like it has a published grammar yet. My Beads project is a deductive language, and the reason i bumped into Red is that your latest addition of automatic recalculation does intersect with the deductive model. I consider this latest addition to be one of the greatest things you have added to the Red language. Anyway you are a busy guy, and i just wanted to touch base and connect so that the three team leaders each know each other exists.}

If you study the history of art and music, all the pioneers knew each other to some extent. 99.9% of people will use existing tools, only a few determined and possibly reckless people dare to build their own.

    text: {@greggirwin The biggest issue with Cycle.js is not the framework per se, but that they picked up something very simple as example, and turned it into a monster code. For more complex cases, processing globally events as streams is an interesting approach where FRP can provide a pretty clean solution. I plan to add event streams support at some point, and have similar reactive HOF support, though, Red should be able to achieve it in a much lighter way. I'm pretty sure you could already implement such framework for GUI events in pure Red by just adding a global event handler and creating a reactive stream out of captured events there.}
