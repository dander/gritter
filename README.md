# gritter
Gitter client written in Red

## About

This is very basic and unfinished Gitter client written in Red. To run it, type `do %gritter.red` in Red console. 
You would be prompted to type your Gitter token (there is no OAuth login yet).
After that, Gritter can run.

Do NOT expect it to be very useful right now, DO expect bugs and crashes.
